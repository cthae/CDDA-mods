# CDDA-mods

Just making my local CDDA mods available.

1. **Armored_Wheel_Offroad** - Adds the offroad flag to armored wheels. CDDA devs claim the armored wheel is too good to be offroad. Well, I disagree. There we go.
2. **Hauling_Space** - Returns the Hauling space to the game right like it used to be. The devs decided to just get rid of it, which killed all my items in the car. Well, now it's back here with this mod.
3. **No_Portal_Storms** - Effectively disables portal storms. The storms are pretty trivial to survive, and yet they're really annoying. Every 5-18 days becomes super annoying when you're playing for a few in-game years. Probably ok if you do like 30-days runs, but then where's the fun in short runs?
4. **No Zombie Revivification** - Prevents Zombs from reviving.

Just copy the chosen folders to your `cdda\data\mods`. You can edit your `cdda\save\<world>\mods.json` file and add the mods into an active playthrough, using mod idents from the `modinfo.json`
